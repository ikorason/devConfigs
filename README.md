# Work in progress

This is a work in progress repo for my personal dev config files.

Step 1.

- Install homebrew
- Install zsh
- Install neovim - via brew

Neovim - NvChad

I use [NvChad]("https://nvchad.com/") as based config for my neovim configuratio, but I commit all of my custom mappins and configs in the nvim/custom dir

Notes:

- before install telescope and create keymap for “grep”, install ripgrep - brew - in order for searching words works
- install treesitter
